# Physical AI & Humanoid Robots – AI Systems in the Physical World

This repository contains the complete textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, designed to guide students and practitioners through the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is organized into four progressive parts that take you on a journey from basic principles to advanced autonomy:

- **Part I** covers the foundations of Physical AI and robotic systems
- **Part II** explores the ROS 2 framework that powers modern robotics
- **Part III** delves into simulation and digital twins for robot development
- **Part IV** examines vision-language-action models and autonomous decision-making

## Learning Approach

This book follows a simulation-first, hardware-agnostic approach that emphasizes safety and practical understanding. Each chapter builds upon previous concepts while maintaining self-contained explanations for accessibility.

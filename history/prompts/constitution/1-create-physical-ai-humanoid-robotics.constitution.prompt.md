## Prompt

Create a constitution for a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project with the following details:
- Project Name: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – An AI-Native Textbook
- Mission: Create a comprehensive AI-native textbook that teaches Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics by bridging artificial intelligence with real-world robotic systems
- Principles: Spec-driven development, AI-first content creation, Clear learning progression, Modular and reusable intelligence, Practical, example-driven instruction
- Audience: students, beginners to intermediate, Medical & Science students, AI and Robotics practitioners
- Success Criteria: 4-part structured textbook, 16 cohesive chapters, Deployed using Docusaurus, Ready for RAG, personalization, and translation extensions

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project with six core principles:
1. Spec-driven development
2. AI-first content creation
3. Clear learning progression
4. Modular and reusable intelligence
5. Practical, example-driven instruction
6. Accessibility and inclusivity

Also included Content Standards and Development Workflow sections, and Governance section with version 1.0.0.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete project constitution with 6 core principles and governance structure
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (documentation task)
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan development, spec creation, task generation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution properly reflects project mission and requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin specification development based on constitution

# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – An AI-Native Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-driven development
All content creation and textbook structure must follow a specification-first approach. Every chapter and section must have clear, documented requirements before implementation. This ensures comprehensive coverage and prevents scope creep.

### AI-first content creation
Content must leverage AI-native approaches for generation, organization, and presentation. All chapters should demonstrate how AI technologies enable and enhance physical robotics systems. AI tools must be used for content optimization, personalization, and accessibility.

### Clear learning progression
Each chapter must build logically on previous concepts with clear prerequisite knowledge stated. Content must follow a structured path from beginner to intermediate level understanding. All concepts must include practical examples and hands-on applications.

### Modular and reusable intelligence
Content must be structured in modular, self-contained sections that can be reused and recombined. Each chapter and section should be independently understandable while contributing to the overall learning objectives. Content should be designed for multiple learning paths and custom course structures.

### Practical, example-driven instruction
All theoretical concepts must be accompanied by practical examples, code samples, and real-world applications. Each chapter must include hands-on exercises and implementation examples. Content must bridge the gap between theory and practice with concrete implementations.

### Accessibility and inclusivity
Content must be accessible to students from diverse backgrounds including medical and science students. All examples and explanations must be clear and approachable for beginners while still valuable for practitioners. Documentation must support multiple learning styles and accessibility requirements.

## Content Standards
All content must be technically accurate and up-to-date with current AI and robotics research. Chapters must include practical implementation examples using modern tools and frameworks. All code samples must be tested and verified to work. Content must be reviewed by domain experts before publication.

## Development Workflow
Content development follows a structured 4-part structure with 16 cohesive chapters. All content must be developed using Docusaurus for deployment. Each chapter must pass quality gates including technical accuracy review, accessibility check, and learning effectiveness validation. Content must be ready for RAG, personalization, and translation extensions.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the textbook development process. All content creators and reviewers must adhere to these principles. Amendments to this constitution require documentation of the change, approval from project leadership, and a migration plan for existing content. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles before approval.

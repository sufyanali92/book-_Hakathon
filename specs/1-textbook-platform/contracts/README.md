# Contracts: AI-Native Technical Textbook Platform

This directory contains API contracts and interface definitions for the textbook platform.

For Phase 1, the platform is a static site with no dynamic APIs, so contracts primarily define:
- Content structure and metadata formats
- Navigation data structures
- Search index schema

Future phases will include API contracts for dynamic features like user tracking, personalization, and RAG functionality.
